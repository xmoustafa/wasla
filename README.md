## 💡 What is Wasla?

**Wasla** is an intelligent, lightweight **Multi-Source Job Discovery Engine** designed specifically for job seekers, students, and professionals in **Egypt 🇪🇬, Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦, and the UAE 🇦🇪**.

Instead of manually checking multiple sites every day, getting bombarded with irrelevant leads, or seeing the exact same job reposted five times under slightly different titles, **Wasla orchestrates the entire discovery process autonomously**:
1. **Discovers** listings across independent sources (**LinkedIn, Indeed, and Tanqeeb**) plus public LinkedIn recruiter-post leads.
2. **Classifies** seniority, contract types, and work environments using title-first rules.
3. **Hard-Filters** out irrelevant roles before they ever reach your screen.
4. **Deduplicates** cross-source duplicates using a conservative multi-signal confidence engine.
5. **Ranks** results by relevance and presents them with direct apply links and source badges.

> **Zero accounts, zero logins, zero API credentials required.** Wasla uses clean, public, and stable guest endpoints.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. 🌐 True Multi-Source Discovery
- **LinkedIn Integration (`LinkedInSource`):** Guest job search targeting relevant postings across MENA and globally.
- **Tanqeeb Regional Network (`TanqeebSource`):** Automatic subdomain routing tailored to the user's selected country:
  - **Egypt 🇪🇬:** Routed to `egypt.tanqeeb.com` (Cairo, Alexandria, Mansoura, Giza, etc.)
  - **Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦:** Routed to `saudi.tanqeeb.com` (Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Mecca, etc.)
  - **United Arab Emirates 🇦🇪:** Routed to `uae.tanqeeb.com` (Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, etc.)
  - **Gulf & MENA:** Supports Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, and Jordan.
- **Fault-Isolated Execution:** If one source experiences a temporary network hiccup, the other source continues seamlessly without crashing or surfacing stack traces.
- **Indeed (`IndeedSource`):** Searches Indeed's public regional pages; if Indeed presents an anti-bot challenge, the source fails safely and the other sources continue.
- **LinkedIn recruiter-post leads:** Finds public LinkedIn post URLs using a public web index. These are clearly labeled as leads because they may require messaging the recruiter rather than submitting through an ATS.

### 2. 🛡️ Intelligent Multi-Signal Deduplication (`dedup.py`)
> **Core Principle: "A false merge is far worse than an undetected duplicate."**

Wasla avoids naive `company + title` merges that hide real jobs. Instead, it uses a multi-signal confidence engine:
- **Canonical URL Matching:** Cleans and normalizes URLs by stripping tracking queries (`utm_*`, `ref`, `trk`).
- **Conservative Company Normalization:** Strips *only* pure legal suffixes (`LLC`, `Ltd`, `Inc`, `Corp`, `ش.م.م`). Crucial corporate identity tokens like `Technologies`, `Solutions`, `Systems`, and `Labs` are strictly preserved (e.g., *Smart Eye* and *Smart Eye Technologies* remain separate).
- **Location Guardrails:** Same company and title in different cities (e.g., Cairo vs. Alexandria) are strictly kept as **2 separate jobs**.
- **Smart Merging:** When verified as identical, the card is merged with dual badges (`✨ LinkedIn · Tanqeeb`) and points to the best direct application link.

---

### 3. 🎯 High-Precision Filtering (Zero False Positives)
- **Hard-Gated Internship Filter:** When searching for internships or training programs:
  - Rejects any leadership or senior title (`Senior`, `Lead`, `Staff`, `Architect`, `Director`, `Manager`, `Head`).
  - Rejects postings with explicit experience requirements (e.g., `1–2 years`, `2+ yrs`, `خبرة 3 سنوات`).
  - Excludes cross-domain noise (e.g., Marketing or HR roles when searching for Software).
- **Smart Intent Normalization:** Typing `Flutter intern` automatically extracts the core skill (`Flutter`) and sets the seniority filter to `Internship`, preventing conflicting dork queries.
- **Seniority Tiers:**
  - `الكل (أي مستوى)` - All levels
  - `تدريب طلبة وخريجين (Internship)` - Pure internships and graduate programs
  - `مبتدئ / حديث تخرج (Junior / Entry)` - Entry-level roles, blocking senior and 3+ years requirements
  - `متوسط الخبرة (Mid-Level)` - Mid-level opportunities
  - `سينيور / خبير (Senior / Lead)` - Senior, Lead, and Architect roles
  - `إدارة وقيادة (Manager / Director)` - Departmental and executive management
- **Workplace Environments:** Remote (`عن بُعد`), Hybrid (`هجين`), or On-site (`من المقر`).
- **Emiratisation exclusion:** A default-on checkbox removes postings explicitly marked `UAE National`, `Emirati`, `For Emirate`, or `Emiratisation`; turn it off to review those results with a visible warning badge.
- **Fast mode and concurrency:** Sources run in parallel. Fast mode checks one page per source; disable it when you prefer wider coverage over speed.

---

### 4. 🎨 Modern Dark Theme Interface
- **Responsive RTL UI:** Styled with Google Cairo typography, glowing accent borders, and glassmorphic filter controls.
- **Live Source Badges:**
  - `LinkedIn` (Classic Blue)
  - `Tanqeeb (تنقيب)` (Emerald Green)
  - `✨ LinkedIn · Tanqeeb` (Gradient Purple for merged multi-source opportunities)
- **Dynamic Apply Buttons:** Automatically adapts text based on the source (`قدّم على LinkedIn ↗`, `قدّم على Tanqeeb ↗`, or `قدّم على الرابط المباشر ↗`).
- **Arabic Excel / CSV Export:** One-click download with `UTF-8 with BOM` encoding for seamless Arabic text display in Microsoft Excel.
